1.	Why is file storage important when you’re using Python? What would happen if you didn’t store local files?
There are a few scenarios that can complicate the script if we do not save them in a file, for example that we can lose track of variables assigned, as well data can be lost at the end of the program or unavailable since the interpreter reaches the end of your script.

2.	In this Exercise you learned about the pickling process with the pickle.dump() method. What are pickles? In which situations would you choose to use pickles and why? 
It is a module implementation in binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.

3.	In Python, what function do you use to find out which directory you’re currently in? What if you wanted to change your current working directory?
The command os.getcwd() helps you find in which directory you are currently.
The command os-chdir() will allow you to change the current directory you are in.

4.	Imagine you’re working on a Python script and are worried there may be an error in a block of code. How would you approach the situation to prevent the entire script from terminating due to an error?
The try-except blocks will allow for a better run of the program because it will inform the user of any error happening, how to come around or what needs the user to change, and not break down as it might happen without it.
