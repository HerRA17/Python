# Setting up Data Structures & Data types
* I decided to use a Dictionary as the data type for the 1st recipe, because referring to JS as an object, the data provided will contain a key-value pair and additionally they are mutable meaning there can be adjustments done to correct or change any unexpected values.
* For the all Recipes structure I decided to use a list since it is another type of ordered sequence that can be as well mutable.
