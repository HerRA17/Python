## Initial Setup
### Make sure you already satisfy the prerequisites!
1. Clone the Repository:
First, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine. Use the following command:
```
 git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
```
Replace YourUsername and YourRepositoryName with the appropriate GitHub username and repository name.

2. Create a Virtual Environment:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects. This keeps dependencies required by different projects separate. To create a virtual environment, navigate to the project directory and run:
``` 
python -m venv name-of-venv

```
Replace name-of-venv with your preferred name for the virtual environment.

3. Activate the Virtual Environment:
To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

On Windows:
```
name-of-venv\Scripts\activate
```
4. Install Dependencies:
With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Set Up the Database (MySQL):
Install MySQL: [link to download MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html)
And follow the instructions.
Through SQLAlchemy module you will establish a connection with MySQL database in the format mysql://username:password@host/database specifies the database type (MySQL), username, password, host, and database name.
